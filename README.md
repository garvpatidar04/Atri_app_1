# Atri_app_1

Here I have created a clone (https://portfolio-webflow-html-website-template.webflow.io/) of this website using atri framework, it was quite easy to position and add property to it as everything is really simple but there are some advanced property which are not avilable in that framework like grid and gradient coloring and ..

If you want to try this framework go to their documentation and follow the steps to install the framework (https://docs.atrilabs.com/)

You might face some issues:
 <ol>
    <li>The term 'pipenv' is not recognized as the name of a cmdlet
        <ul><li>for above issue do this -->  Add pipenv to the PATH environment variable</li></ul>
    </li>
</ol>
 <p></p>
 and more error like this so follow their documentation to solve the issues and search on google.
